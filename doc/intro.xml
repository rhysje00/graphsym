<Index Key="GRSYLI">&GRSYLI; package overview</Index>

  This is the manual for the &GRSYLI; package version &VERSION;.
  <P/>
  The &GRSYLI; package contains various collections of graphs with interesting 
  symmetry properties. Each collection of graphs are attained from complete or 
  partial enumerations published in international journals. The papers 
  containing these enumerations are referenced throughout this document, and 
  their authors are included as contributors (unless they are an author of this
  package). The &GRSYLI; package provides functionality enabling easy access to 
  these graphs, along with several precomputed properties related to many of 
  the graphs stored within.",
  <P/>
  Currently, all of the functions in this package deal with finite graphs in 
  &DIGRAPHS; format <Cite Key="DIGRAPHS_2019"/>, and much of the functionality
  provided is based on the very nice code found in 
  <Ref BookName="digraphs" Chap="Visualising and IO"/>.

<Index>&GRSYLI;</Index>

To install the &GRSYLI; package, you first need to download or clone the 
package, found at &PKGWWWHOME;. Once downloaded, there is no need for any extra
compiling. 

If possible, it is recommended that you place the &GRSYLI; directory into the 
package directory of your &GAP; distribution. For guidance on how to load
&GRSYLI; package if you cannot move the directory directly into your &GAP; 
package directory, see Section <Ref Sect="load"/>.
<!-- To install the &GRSYLI; package, you will need to download the most recent 
<C>tar.gz</C> file, found at &PKGWWWHOME;. Once downloaded, 
 you can install the 
package by following the instructions found in the &GAP; reference manual, 
<URL Text="chapter 76">https://docs.gap-system.org/doc/ref/chap76.html</URL>.
-->
<P/>
The &GRSYLI; package requires the following &GAP; packages:
<List>
<Item><Package>GAPDoc</Package> <Cite Key="GAPDOC_2019"/>, version 1.6.6 or higher;</Item>
<Item><Package>Digraphs</Package> <Cite Key="DIGRAPHS_2019"/>, version 1.6.1 or higher.</Item>
</List>
Each of the above packages are part of the standard &GAP; distribution.

<Section Label="build doc">
<Heading>Building the documentation for &GRSYLI;</Heading>

Once downloaded, you can build all package documentation by running 
<C>gap path/to/grsyli/makedoc.g</C> from the command line. This will build a pdf 
version of this manual and save it in the directory <C>path/to/grsyli/doc/</C>, 
as well as provide the &GAP; help viewer with the content of the manual.

<Section Label="load">
<Heading>Loading &GRSYLI;</Heading>

If the &GRSYLI; package has been downloaded and placed in the &GAP; package 
directory, it can by loaded at the &GAP; prompt by typing the following.
<Example>
gap> LoadPackage("grsyli");
true
</Example>

Otherwise, you can follow the methods found in the &GAP; reference manual, 
<URL Text="chapter 76">https://docs.gap-system.org/doc/ref/chap76.html</URL>. 
For example, if <C>path/to/grsyli</C> is the path to the &GRSYLI; package 
directory relative to your &GAP; session, it can be loaded at the &GAP; prompt 
by typing the following.
<Example>
gap> SetPackagePath("grsyli","path/to/grsyli");
gap> LoadPackage("grsyli");
true
</Example>
