  [33X[0;0YThis is the manual for the [5XGraphSym[105X package version 0.1.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe [5XGraphSym[105X package contains various collections of graphs with interesting
  symmetry properties. Each collection of graphs are attained from complete or
  partial   enumerations  published  in  international  journals.  The  papers
  containing  these  enumerations are referenced throughout this document, and
  their  authors  are  included  as contributors (unless they are an author of
  this  package).  The  [5XGraphSym[105X  package provides functionality enabling easy
  access to these graphs, along with several precomputed properties related to
  many of the graphs stored within.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YCurrently,  all  of the functions in this package deal with finite graphs in
  [5XDigraphs[105X  format  [DBJM+19], and much of the functionality provided is based
  on the very nice code found in [14X'Digraphs: Visualising and IO'[114X.[133X

  [33X[0;0YTo  install  the  [5XGraphSym[105X  package, you first need to download or clone the
  package,  found  at  https://rhysje00.github.io/graphsym/.  Once downloaded,
  there  is  no  need  for any extra compiling. If possible, it is recommended
  that you place the [5XGraphSym[105X directory into the package directory of your [5XGAP[105X
  distribution.  For  guidance  on  how to load [5XGraphSym[105X package if you cannot
  move  the  directory  directly  into your [5XGAP[105X package directory, see Section
  [14X1.3[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe [5XGraphSym[105X package requires the following [5XGAP[105X packages:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[5XGAPDoc[105X [LN19], version 1.6.6 or higher;[133X

  path/to/graphsym/makedoc.g[110X  from  the  command  line.  This will build a pdf
  version  of  this manual and save it in the directory [10Xpath/to/graphsym/doc/[110X,
  as well as provide the [5XGAP[105X help viewer with the content of the manual.[133X
