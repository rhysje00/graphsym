<Heading><M>G</M>&ndash;half&ndash;arc&ndash;transitive graphs</Heading>

In this Chapter we give functions for accessing the <M>G</M>-half-arc-transitive 
4-valent graphs stored in this package, and related properties. Currently, this package 
contains all <M>G</M>-half-arc-transitive 4-valent graphs on up to 1000 vertices. For information 
and references on these graphs, see <Cite Key="PSV_2013a"/>.
<P/>
Let <M>\Gamma</M> be a simple graph (undirected, loopless, without multiple 
edges). Then <M>\Gamma</M> is <E>4-valent</E> (or <E>tetravalent</E>) if each 
vertex of the graph has exactly 4 neighbours.
<P/>
The graph <M>\Gamma</M> is <M>G</M><E>-half-arc-transitive</E> if <M>G</M> is a group
of automorphisms of <M>\Gamma</M> which acts transitively on the vertices and edges of 
<M>\Gamma</M>, but not on the arcs of <M>\Gamma</M>.

<Section Label="ghat 4-valent library info">
<Heading>Properties of the <M>G</M>&ndash;half&ndash;arc&ndash;transitive 4&ndash;valent graphs and library</Heading>

In this Section we give the functions which give information about the 
<M>G</M>-half-arc-transitive 4-valent graph library, and the properties and attributes of 
the graphs it contains.

<Subsection Label="Precomputed data ghat">
<Heading>Precomputed attributes of the <M>G</M>&ndash;half&ndash;arc&ndash;transitive 4&ndash;valent graphs</Heading>

For a given <M>G</M>-half-arc-transitive 4-valent graph <M>\Gamma</M> stored in this package, 
there are several precomputed attributes stored in the &GraphSym; package. These 
include the following:

<List>
<Item> Diameter of <M>\Gamma</M>
       (<Ref BookName="digraphs" Attr="DigraphDiameter"/>). </Item>
<Item> Girth of <M>\Gamma</M> 
       (<Ref BookName="digraphs" Attr="DigraphUndirectedGirth"/>). </Item>
<Item> Bipartiteness of <M>\Gamma</M>
       (<Ref BookName="digraphs" Prop="IsBipartiteDigraph"/>). </Item>
<Item> Arc-transitivity of <M>\Gamma</M> 
       (<Ref Prop="IsArcTransitiveDigraph"/>). </Item>
<Item>The Cayley type of <M>\Gamma</M>
      (<Ref Attr="CayleyType"/>).</Item>
<!-- <Item>The size of the stabilizer of a vertex in the automorphism group
      of <M>\Gamma</M> (<Ref Attr="SizeStabAut"/>).</Item>   
<Item>The size of the stabilizer of a vertex in the half-arc-transitive 
      group of automorphisms of <M>\Gamma</M> 
      (<Ref Attr="SizeStabGHATGroups"/>).</Item>   
<Item>The solvability of the automorphism group of <M>\Gamma</M>
      (<Ref Prop="HasSolvableAutGroup"/>).</Item> -->
<Item>The consistent cycle types of <M>\Gamma</M>
      (<Ref Attr="ConsistentCycleTypes"/>).</Item>
</List>

</Subsection>

Now we introduce functions which are used to find information about
the library and each of the graphs it stores.
